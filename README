h1. Getting Started

To get started, simply add the directories with the Pearl modules that you need to your project.  You probably want to make a Pearl static library target for these.

Then, import the module headers in your project target's prefix.  Eg.

    #import "Pearl.h"
    #import "Pearl-WS.h"


h1. Dependencies

Some modules require additional dependencies: they can be found in the External directory.  To fetch them, simply run:

    git submodule update --init --recursive External/[dependency]

To update them when you update Pearl from git, run:

    git submodule update --recursive --merge

Don't forget to also add the external library's sources to your project.  You probably want to put each under a separate static library target.  Some libraries have a bit of a different directory layout, make sure to only add the library's sources that you need.
