To get started, just add the iLibs directory in the iLibs root directory to your Xcode project and optionally delete whatever groups are irrelevant to your project.

Some groups require additional dependencies, they can be found in the External directory.  To fetch them, simply run:

git submodule update --init External/[dependency]
