Supported toggles for this module:
    - PEARL_WITH_OPENSSL: Add support for OpenSSL. Enables PearlRSAKey.

Defines that can be overridden to alter behavior:
    - kCipherAlgorithm (Default: kCCAlgorithmAES128)
    - kCipherKeySize (Default: kCCKeySizeAES128)
    - kCipherBlockSize (Default: 8)

The following externals provide source code for my binary dependencies:
    - PEARL_WITH_OPENSSL: iOSPorts/ports/security/openssl/openssl.xcodeproj: crypto
    
To add these externals, there are two options:
    1. Build the external from source.
    2. Link with the external's pre-built library.

Setup:

    a. If you want to build the external from source, add the external's target (eg. crypto) to your application target under "Link Binary With Libraries".
    b. If you want to link with the pre-built library, add the library (eg. libcrypto-ios.a) to your application target under "Link Binary With Libraries".
