Supported toggles for this module:
    - PEARL_WITH_OPENSSL: Add support for OpenSSL. Enables PearlRSAKey.
    - PEARL_WITH_SCRYPT:  Add support for SCrypt. Enables PearlSCrypt.

Defines that can be overridden to alter behavior:
    - kCipherAlgorithm (Default: kCCAlgorithmAES128)
    - kCipherKeySize (Default: kCCKeySizeAES128)
    - kCipherBlockSize (Default: 8)

I depend on the following externals:

    - PEARL_WITH_OPENSSL: iOSPorts/ports/security/openssl/openssl.xcodeproj: crypto
    - PEARL_WITH_SCRYPT : iOSPorts/ports/security/scrypt/scrypt.xcodeproj: scryptenc (includes crypto)
    
To add these externals, there are two options:
    1. Build the external from source.
    2. Link with the external's pre-built library.

Setup:

    1. Add the external project (eg. openssl.xcodeproj) to your project.
    2. In your application target, add the following build setting:
        HEADER_SEARCH_PATHS = [path-to-Pearl]/External/iOSPorts/include/**
    3a. If you want to build the external from source, add the external's target (eg. crypto) to your application target under "Link Binary With Libraries".
    3b. If you want to link with the pre-built library, add the library (eg. libcrypto-ios.a) to your application target under "Link Binary With Libraries".
    4b. Add the external Makefile target (eg. Makefile-openssl) to your application target under "Target Dependencies".
